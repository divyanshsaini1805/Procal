			<h3>221b Baker St.</h3>
			<p>
			November 1895. London is shrouded in fog and Sherlock Holmes and
			Watson pass time restlessly awaiting a new case. "The London
			criminal is certainly a dull fellow," Sherlock bemoans. "There have
			been numerous petty thefts," Watson offers in response. Just then a
			telegram arrives from Sherlock's brother Mycroft with a mysterious
			case.

			<h3>Aldgate Station</h3>
			<p>
			Arthur Cadogan West was found dead, head crushed in on train tracks
			at Aldgate Station at 6AM Tuesday morning. West worked at Woolwich
			Arsenal on the Bruce-Partington submarine, a secret military
			project. Plans for the submarine had been stolen and seven of the
			ten missing papers were found in West's possession. Mycroft implores
			Sherlock to take the case and recover the three missing papers.

			<h3>London Bridge</h3>
			<p>
			Holmes and Watson's investigations take them across London. Sherlock
			deduces that West was murdered elsewhere, then moved to Aldgate
			Station to create the illusion that he was crushed on the tracks by
			a train. On their way to Woolwich Sherlock dispatches a telegram to
			Mycroft at London Bridge: "Send list of all foreign spies known to
			be in England, with full address."
			</p>
			</section>
			<section id="woolwich">
			<h3>Woolwich Arsenal</h3>
			<p>
			While investigating at Woolwich Arsenal Sherlock learns that West
			did not have the three keys&mdash;door, office, and
			safe&mdash;necessary to steal the papers. The train station clerk
			mentions seeing an agitated West boarding the 8:15 train to London
			Bridge. Sherlock suspects West of following someone who had access
			to the Woolwich chief's keyring with all three keys.

			<h3>Gloucester Road</h3>
			<p>
			Mycroft responds to Sherlock's telegram and mentions several spies.
			Hugo Oberstein of 13 Caulfield Gardens catches Sherlock's eye. He
			heads to the nearby Gloucester Road station to investigate and
			learns that the windows of Caulfield Gardens open over rail tracks
			where trains stop frequently.

			<h3>13 Caulfield Gardens</h3>
			<p>
			Holmes deduces that the murderer placed West atop a stopped train at
			Caulfield Gardens. The train traveled to Aldgate Station before
			West's body finally toppled off. Backtracking to the criminal's
			apartment, Holmes finds a series of classified ads from
			<em>The Daily Telegraph</em> stashed away. All are under the name
			Pierrot: "Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not
			be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered."
			</p>
			</section>
			<section id="telegraph">
			<h3>The Daily Telegraph</h3>
			<p>
			Holmes and Watson head to The Daily Telegraph and place an ad to
			draw out the criminal. It reads: "To-night. Same hour. Same place.
			Two taps. Most vitally important. Your own safety at stake.
			Pierrot." The trap works and Holmes catches the criminal: Colonel
			Valentine Walter, the brother of Woolwich Arsenal's chief. He
			confesses to working for Hugo Oberstein to obtain the submarine
			plans in order to pay off his debts.
			</p>

			<section id="charing-cross">
			<h3>Charing Cross Hotel</h3>
			<p>
			Walter writes to Oberstein and convinces him to meet in the smoking
			room of the Charing Cross Hotel where he promises additional plans
			for the submarine in exchange for money. The plan works and Holmes
			and Watson catch both criminals.
